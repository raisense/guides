So, Here I am writing basic patterns on how to manage this repository. 

Basically, every maintainer who is added as a contributor should create a folder in the root of the repository with the name of the division he is working in.
Let's say:
> If I am working in _back-end team_, then basically I will create a folder called **backend**

Then every corresponding folder should consist of at least one README.md file so that all the best practices belonging to that division will live there.

Here, for the beginning, I am tagging the main maintainers and contributors, so we will see in the process of writing it on how it goes on and maybe we will update the list. But, for now they are:
@asdfgh5889 
@Rawdreen 
@shurmanov 
@Teo0303 
@bedilbek

Feel free to contact any of them if you notice some mistake in the context of the corresponding guides.
