So, Here I am writing basic patterns on how to manage this repository. 

Basically, every maintainer who is added as a contributor should open a folder in the root of the repository with the name of the division he is working in.
Let's say:
> if I am working in _back-end team_, then basically I will open a folder called **backend**

Then every corresponding folder should consist of at least one README.md file so that all the best practices belonging to that division will live there.

Here, for the beginning I am tagging the main maintainers and contributors, so we will see in the process, how it goes on and maybe we will update the list of maintainers.
